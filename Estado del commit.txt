This commits imports the class SQLAlchemy and creates a instance db "database" in the app file.

A models.py file is created and it contents a class Task with the db.model structured, this structure consists of an ID and a title.

You can verify the functionality of the code by typing the following instruction on the python terminal:
    from app import db    
    from models import db
    db.create_all()
    from models import Task
    task1 = Task(title="Task Name")
