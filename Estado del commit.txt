This commits imports the instance db from the app.py to save the text typed on the stringfield as a new task
imports the function redirect and url_for from flask to redirect the flow to index once a new task has been submitted

In order to save the new task on the database the add function uses the following code lines:
    db.session.add(task)
    db.session.commit()

In order to read the tasks saved on the data base the index function uses the following code lines:
    tasks = Task.query.all()

In order to show the tasks saved on the data based the inde.html uses a for to print as an unorder list each task.
