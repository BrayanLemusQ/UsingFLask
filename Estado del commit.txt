This commits uses the function "render_template" hability to pass variables to the html file by passing an extra argument in the function call
which must have the name of the variable.
    render_template("example.html, <variable_name>)

The goodbye function is also changed to use the render_template function.
Finally a variable "name" is passed to the homepage and the goodbye page as an argument
