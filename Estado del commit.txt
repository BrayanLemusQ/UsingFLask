This commits reorganizes the code so it can be more simple, it creates a routes.py file that contents all the routes that are need it to the web application
To do so, is important to import all in the app.py file from the routes.py file inmediatelly after the app is created

The line from OS import name is deleted becouse it was an error, and this function was not used.
